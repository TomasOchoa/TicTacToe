# A Tic-Tac-Toe Game

My implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using jQuery and JavaScript.

## To Do:

- [x] Lock game board after winner showed
- [x] Finish show tie function
    - [x] Implement turn counter
    - [x] Show tie if checkWinner() returns false && amount of turns player == 9
- [x] Implement reset
    - [x] Include reset event listener for button
    - [x] Create reset logic on event fired
- [x] Highlight All available moves if a move is invalid
- [x] Style Jumbotron
    - [ ] Add jumbotron style for Tie
- [ ] Maybe make some animations for win/tie/displays?
- [ ] Create a scoreboard
    - [ ] Score for player 1 & player 2
    - [ ] Display number of turns played
    - [ ] Make it like an electric scoreboard
