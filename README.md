# A Tic-Tac-Toe Game

My implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using jQuery and JavaScript.

## To Do:

- [ ] Lock game board after winner showed
- [ ] Finish show tie function
    - [ ] Implement turn counter
    - [ ] Show tie if checkWinner() returns false && amount of turns player == 9
- [ ] Style Jumbotron
- [ ] Implement reset
    - [ ] Include reset event listener for button
    - [ ] Create reset logic on event fired
- [ ] Maybe make some animations for win/tie/displays?
